# Week Sauce Game Jam (February 2024) - Remake a "Terrible" Minigame

Welcome to the Week Sauce Game Jam of February 2024! This event is a unique opportunity for game developers of all skill levels to challenge themselves, learn, and have fun. Our theme this year is "Remake a 'Terrible' Minigame." It's time to turn those frustrating, poorly designed, or simply dull minigames into something extraordinary!

## Theme

Remake a "Terrible" Minigame: Dive into the annals of gaming history (or your own past projects) to find those minigames that made you groan, roll your eyes, or question the developers' sanity. Your task is to remake one of these minigames. Transform it into an engaging, fun, and polished experience that players will love.

## About

### Game Engine

We will be using the latest version of Unity. At the time of writing this, that version is 2023.2.8f1. This can be found within the Unity Hub installation section. Reach out if you have any questions!

### Starting Template

This project was created using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). It is currently geared towards a 3D project but can easily be converted to a 2D project.
